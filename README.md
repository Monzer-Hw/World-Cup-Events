## Dataset
The project is based on two main datasets:
1. [The Fjelstul World Cup Database](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)
2. [World Cup Attendance Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4FNJB6T5LMpSMOtPv3WIa7nOjTFAC3z/view)

the datasets are provided in the data folder.

## Technologies Used
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several main sections:

1. **Data Cleaning and Integration**
   - Merging attendance dataset with the Fjelstul dataset
   - Creating a new dataframe for players and their represented teams

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features such as total goals, host team indicator, capacity ratio, etc.
   - Discretization of attendance and capacity ratio features

3. **Exploration and Analysis**
   - Attendance Case Study
   - Goals Case Study
   - Matches Case Study
   - Tournament Case Study

## Key Findings
- Attendance patterns and trends across World Cup history
- Goal scoring statistics and trends
- Analysis of top goal scorers and tournament goal trends
- Frequency analysis of matches between teams
- Insights into players representing multiple teams
- Relationships between host countries, tournament winners, and attendance

   ````
   For windows:
   ````bash
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ````
3. Run the following commands:
   
   To create a virtual environment with the required libraries:
   ````bash
   uv sync
   ````

   To create a kernel for the jupyter notebook:
   ````bash

   ````
4. Run the jupyter notebook with this command:
   ````bash
   uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
   ````
   Or just select the virtual environment and run the notebook if you have VS Code with jupyter extention.
